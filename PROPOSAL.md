My final project will be called Forrest Gump Pong based on Forrest Gump's ping pong skills in the movie. In the movie Forrest Gump is able to play against himself by putting the other half of the table up. He's even able to play with multiple ping pong balls. For my project I would like to make a single player pong game that is Forrest Gump themed. I will be motivated to see this project until the end becuase Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies and I have seen it several times.

A player will have a paddle that they can move vertically along one edge of the box that is open. The rest of the box will be closed. If the ball goes past the open end, the player loses. I will add the feature to add multiple balls by pressing a key.

By the end of week 1 I will have finished the game mechanics that I just described and start on the feature to add multiple balls (that bounce off of each other) by pressing a key.

By the end of week 2 I will have finished the feature to add multiple balls by pressing a key. I will make each ball Forrest Gump's face. and add a line down the middle of the table to simulate a ping pong table. I will also add forrest gump's face to the middle of the table where the ping pong balls spawn. I will have a ping pong ball sound effect play everytime the ball hits the paddle or opposite wall. I will also add a game engine class that calculates the player's score based on how many ping pong balls are in the table and how much time has passed. If too much time passes sping will be added to the balls. If there's spin, the player's score increases by more. I will also add a screen that displays when the player loses. By the end of this week I will also start on implementing the feature that plays quotes every time a ball is added into the table.

By the end of week 3 I will have finished this custom quote playing feature and will start on a main menu where the player can see their past scores and pick settings for a new game. When the lose the game there will be a key they can press to go back to the main menu.

My stretch goal if I finish early will be to make add music and more audio sfx to the gameplay.
